# ReferenceEnhancer

The goal of ReferenceEnhancer is to generate a scRNA-seq optimized transcriptomic reference.

Generating a scRNA-seq optimized transcriptomic reference requires optimizing the genome annotation ("xxx.gtf") file that transcriptomic references are based on.

The following three aspects of genome annotations need to be optimized: A) Resolving gene overlap derived read loss; B) Recovering intergenic reads from 3' un-annotated exons; and C) Recovering intronic reads.

After optimizing and assembling the genome annotation, you can use "cellranger mkref" pipeline to assemble the optimized transcriptomic reference for mapping sequencing read data and compiling gene-cell matrices with the "cellranger count" (or other) pipeline.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ReferenceEnhancer as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
require(devtools)
install_github("PoolLab/ReferenceEnhancer")
```

## Example

This is the basic workflow for optimizing a genome annotation for single-cell RNA-seq work using ReferenceEnhancer:

```{r example}
library(ReferenceEnhancer)

genome_annotation <- LoadGtf("test_genes.gtf")
gene_overlaps <- IdentifyOverlappers(genome_annotation)
OverlapResolutions(genome_annotation, gene_overlaps)
IsolateIntergenicReads("test_bam.bam", "test_index.bam.bai")
GenerateGeneLocationBed(genome_annotation)
GenerateExtensionCandidates()
PremrnaAnnotationGenerator(genome_annotation)
OptimizedAnnotationAssembler("test_genes.gtf", "premrna.gtf", "overlapping_gene_list.csv", "gene_extension_candidates.csv", "test_gene_replacement.csv")
```
