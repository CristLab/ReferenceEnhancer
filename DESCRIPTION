Description: Generating a scRNA-seq optimized transcriptomic reference requires optimizing 
  the genome annotation ("xxx.gtf") file that transcriptomic references are based on.  The 
  following three aspects of genome annotations need to be optimized:
  A) Resolving gene overlap derived read loss;
  B) Recovering intergenic reads from 3â€™ un-annotated exons; and
  C) Recovering intronic reads.
  After optimizing and assembling the genome annotation, you can use "cellranger mkref"
  pipeline to assemble the optimized transcriptomic reference for mapping sequencing read
  data and compiling gene-cell matrices with the "cellranger count" (or other) pipeline.
