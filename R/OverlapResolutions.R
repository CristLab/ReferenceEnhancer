#' @title  OverlapResolutions
#'
#' @description Based on original genome annotation GTF file and a list of
#' overlapping genes, generates recommended actions for overlapping genes.
#' This is an optional step that can help with decision making during the manual
#' curation step.
#'
#' Gene overlaps can be resolved by one of several strategies including
#' (i) leaving overlapping gene annotations unchanged if their exons don’t directly overlap,
#' (ii) deleting offending readthrough transcripts from upstream genes,
#' (iii) deleting offending premature gene transcripts from downstream genes,
#' (iv) deleting pseudogenes and non-protein coding genes with poor support and
#' no read mapping that obscure well established protein coding genes or
#' (v) for extensively overlapping genes deleting one and renaming the other to
#' capture otherwise discarded reads. As well annotated genomes contain several
#' thousand same-strand overlapping genes and properly resolving gene overlaps
#' often requires manual inspection of the locus to determine best course of action,
#' prioritization of genes for manual curation is often desirable. To this end,
#' OverlapResolutions function classifies genes to prioritize for direct inspection.
#' The following algorithm is used to classify genes for appropriate curation:
#' 1.	If gene overlaps with multiple genes:
#'    a.	If gene’s exons overlap with another gene’s exons --> classify for “Manual inspection”
#'    b.	If gene’s exons do not overlap with any other genes’ exons --> classify as “Keep as is”
#'    c.	Assign recommended action for overlapping genes:
#'        i.	If nested gene does not overlap with any other gene  classify as “Keep as is”
#'        ii.	If nested gene overlaps with more than one gene  classify for “Manual inspection”
#'2.	If gene overlaps with only one other gene, test whether gene is non-protein
#'coding/pseudogene (“Gm” and “…Rik” gene models in mice; “AC…” and “AL…” gene models in humans)
#'    a.	If both overlapping genes are non-protein coding/pseudogenes --> classify for
#'    “Manual inspection”
#'    b.	If only one gene in the overlapping gene pair is non-protein coding/pseudogene,
#'    test if genes have overlapping exons:
#'        i.	In case no overlapping exons --> classify both genes as “Keep as is”
#'        ii.	In case exons overlap --> mark non-protein coding/pseudogene for
#'        deletion (“Delete”).
#'    c.	If both genes are well supported genes:
#'        i.	If their exons don’t overlap --> mark both genes as “Keep as is”
#'        ii.	If their exons do overlap, determine the number of opposing gene’s
#'        exonic overlap for each exon of each gene and find the exon with most
#'        overlaps for both upstream and downstream gene to determine appropriate
#'        course of action:
#'            1.	If downstream gene’s exon has more overlaps than its upstream
#'            counterpart, classify downstream gene as “Premature transcript deletion”
#'            and upstream gene as “Keep as is”
#'            2.	If upstream gene’s exon has more overlaps than its downstream
#'            counterpart, classify upstream gene as “Readthrough transcript deletion”
#'            and downstream gene as “Keep as is”
#'            3.	Otherwise classify both for “Manual inspection”
#'The resulting recommendations can be used in the manual curation step, where
#'all genes that are not classified in the “Keep as is” category should directly
#'be scrutinized in the Ensembl genome browser (ensemble.org, with the correct
#'genome builds) and/or cross-referenced to the respective Refseq genome annotation
#'within the Integrated Genome Browser (IGV 2.11.9).
#'
#' @param genome_annotation Unoptimized genome annotation (e.g. Ensembl/10x Genomics)
#' default genome annotation GTF file. This should be a dataframe created with the
#' LoadGtf() function in this package.
#' @param overlap_data A list of overlapping genes generated by IdentifyOverlappers.
#' @param gene_pattern The pattern in gene names that is unique for pseudo- or
#' other low quality or low interest genes. Patterns for recognizing candidate
#' pseudo- or low quality genes can be defined with regular expressions for matching
#' gene names with a given pattern. See vignette (regular-expressions) in the stringr
#' package for details or examples below.

#' @return Generates “overlapping_gene_list.csv” with added recommendations for
#' resolving gene overlaps in the “automatic_classification” column.
